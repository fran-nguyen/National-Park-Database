# National-Park-Database
A database for users to find information on national parks in the United States, in a particular state, or to find a specific park.

Hello, my name is Francesca Nguyen!

During the time I created this program, I was a sophomore attending the University of Southern California. One of my introductory Python courses had us create
a directory dedicated to finding and learning more about national parks in the United States. We were not given help or directions seeing that this was our final project
in the course and was asked to use everything we had learned in the four months of the class. I accumulated a hefty understanding of good coding practices and skills
which followed me when I was self-learning R. 

RUNNING THE PROGRAM:
There is a .csv file called "national_parks.csv" that should be downloaded alongside the rest of the files. The program can be run inside PyCharm or another IDE of your
choosing.
